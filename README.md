# FEA Lab Project – Static and Transient Structural Analysis Using ANSYS

This repository contains the complete Finite Element Analysis (FEA) project conducted as part of the FEA Laboratory coursework. The objective of this project is to perform both Static Structural and Transient Structural (Dynamic) simulations on a polygonal component using ANSYS Workbench.

## Project Overview
- Geometry: Hexagon (Roll No. 1874 – Even)
- Material Properties derived from roll number
- Static and Transient loading
- Full FEA workflow including mesh convergence

## Repository Structure
- /Report – Project report (DOCX/PDF)
- /Results – Plots, screenshots, and convergence graphs
